# Footy-Fiesta
A self-interest game built in Unity 3D and scripted in C#, Footy Fiesta is a simple football game wherein a player has to kick the ball into the goal as many times as possible within a limited time-frame.  The coding of the scripts in this project was done in C# language on the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, aided by the Unity Scripting Reference as well as the Microsoft Azure .NET Coding Reference. The game is built on the Unity 3D platform developed by Unity Technologies and employs the Collider-Trigger reactions to generate a goal as an invisible Mesh Renderer is used as a trigger point on the goal. The scoring system and the countdown timer is initialized on a canvas to generate hits on the ball collider colliding with the trigger.
